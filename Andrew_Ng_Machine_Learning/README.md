# Andrew Ng – Machine Learning Specialization

This folder contains my learning progress from Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Specialization.

It includes:
- Supervised learning
- Regression and classification
- Neural networks
- Regularization and optimization
- Practical machine learning implementations

The focus is on understanding both theory and practical application of ML algorithms.
